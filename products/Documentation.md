## 1. Introduction

The E-Commerce API allows for efficient management and retrieval of products, categories, and subcategories. It is built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), providing robust features such as filtering, searching, and error handling.

## 2. API Endpoints

### Product Endpoints

#### `ProductViewSet`

- **List Products**: Retrieve a list of all products with options to search and order.
- **Retrieve Product**: Get detailed information about a specific product.
- **Create Product**: Add a new product to the database.
- **Update Product**: Modify an existing product's details.
- **Delete Product**: Remove a product from the database.
- **Similar Products**: Retrieve similar products based on the same category with optional filters.

### Category Endpoints

#### `CategoryViewSet`

- **List Categories**: Retrieve a list of all categories with their subcategories and products.
- **Retrieve Category**: Get detailed information about a specific category.
- **Create Category**: Add a new category to the database.
- **Update Category**: Modify an existing category's details.
- **Delete Category**: Remove a category from the database.
- **Category Products**: Retrieve products for a given category and optional subcategory.

### Subcategory Endpoints

#### `SubcategoryViewSet`

- **List Subcategories**: Retrieve a list of all subcategories.
- **Retrieve Subcategory**: Get detailed information about a specific subcategory.
- **Create Subcategory**: Add a new subcategory to the database.
- **Update Subcategory**: Modify an existing subcategory's details.
- **Delete Subcategory**: Remove a subcategory from the database.

## 3. Filtering and Searching

The API provides robust filtering and searching capabilities:

- **Search Fields**: Products can be searched by name, description, category name, and tags.
- **Ordering Fields**: Products can be ordered by price and creation date.
- **Filter Parameters**: Products can be filtered by category, name, price range, rating, and tags.

## 4. Error Handling

Error handling is an integral part of the API to ensure robust and user-friendly interactions:

- **Built-in Exceptions**: DRF's built-in exceptions (`NotFound`, `ValidationError`, etc.) are used to handle common errors.
- **Custom Error Responses**: Custom error responses are provided for specific scenarios, ensuring that error messages are clear and informative.
- **Exception Handling Middleware**: A custom exception handler can be implemented to centralize and standardize error responses across the application.

## 5. Performance Optimizations

Performance is enhanced through various techniques:

- **Query Optimization**: The use of `prefetch_related` ensures efficient retrieval of related objects, reducing the number of database queries.
- **Reusable Filters**: Filtering logic is centralized in helper functions to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.
